# Intructions

* Open the Add.js file in VScode. Take a look at the syntax. What does the function do?
* Add the following two lines of code to the end of the file `a = 1` and `b = 2`. Make sure to save
* Run `node Add.js` and inspect the output in your terminal. Did anything show up? Why or why not?
* Add the following line of code to the end of the file `result = add(a, b)`
* Run `node Add.js` again and inspect the output in your terminal. Did anything happen this time?
* add `console.log(result)` to the end of the file and run `node Add.js` one more time
* Would changing the names of the variables `a` and `b` break our code? If so, what would need to be changed in order to fix it?
* Does the order of our code matter? I.e does where we define the funciton `add`, where we declare the variables `a` and `b`, and where we call the function `add` need to happen in a certain sequence?

# Resources

Where in code variables can be accessed (ie are visible) is known as scope. This is a tough topic to fully understand but will come with time and practice. More info on JavaScript Scope can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp)
