# Overview

In order to write useful function, we'll oftentimes need to use comparisons of our inputs values to return a conditional output. Here we'll learn some of the basic JavaScript comparison operators (less than, greater than, equal to, etc...) to add more advanced logic to our functions

## Comparison Operators

* Less than `<` will return `true` if the first value is less than the second value. E.g is `a = 1` and `b = 2`, `a < b` will return `true`
* Greater than `>` will return true if the first values is greater than the second value
* Less than or equal to `<=` will return `true` if the first value is less OR equal to the second value
* Greater than or equal to `>=` will return true if the first values is greater or equal to the second value
* Equals `==` will retrun `true` to both values are equal
* Strict equals `===` will return `true` is both values are equal AND of the same data type. E.g `1 === 1` will return true but `"1" === 1` will return `false`. Since in the latter example we have an instace of `string` and `int` which are not the same data type
* Not equals `!=` will return `true` if both values are not equal
* Strict not equals `!==` will return `true` if both values are not equal OR both values are not of the same data type

# Instructions
* Open the `Comparison.js` file in VSCode
* One by one, fill in the corresponding code
* run `npm test` to test your functions
