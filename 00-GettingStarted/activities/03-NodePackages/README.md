# Intructions

JavaScript is an open source language. There exist a plethora of useful libraries that you can use to avoid reinventing the wheel yourself. Here we'll install our first Node package using Node Package Manager (npm)

We'll be using a library called Jest, a Javascript testing library, throughout the remainder of these activities. This will allow for verification that functions are working properly by running them against a test suite

* run the following command in your terminal `npm install jest -g`
* run the following command `npm list -g` to ensure that jest has been installed
